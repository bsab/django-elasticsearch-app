DEA 
=========

DEA (Django-Elasticsearch-App) is a lightweight app that connect to a local o a remote Elasticsearch node and show an editor to set your query.

No Haystack, no heavy staff :D

Usage
-----

If you prefer to run it directly on your local machine, I suggest using
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) (maybe have a look at
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)),
anyway here the commands you have to enter:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

To download a local copy of Elasticsearch go to :
